Reading Assignment – Polymorphism in Java
-----------------------------------------------

❓ **Câu hỏi 1:**
What is polymorphism? Why is it useful in Object-Oriented Programming?

✅ **Trả lời:**
Polymorphism is one of the four fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), which allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables a single interface to control access to different types of objects.

Polymorphism is useful because:
- It allows writing flexible and reusable code.
- It supports method overriding and dynamic method dispatch.
- It helps decouple code and improves maintainability.

❓ **Câu hỏi 2:**
How does polymorphism work in Java? Give a real example from your lab implementation.

✅ **Trả lời:**
In Java, polymorphism works mainly through:
- Method overriding
- Interface implementation
- Dynamic binding (runtime method selection)

**Ví dụ trong lab:**
In Lab 03, we have an abstract class `Media` and several subclasses such as `DigitalVideoDisc`, `Book`, and `CompactDisc`.  
When we store different types of media in the same `ArrayList<Media>`, and call `toString()` or `equals()` on them, Java uses **dynamic dispatch** to invoke the correct version based on the actual object's type.

```java
List<Media> cart = new ArrayList<>();
cart.add(new DigitalVideoDisc(...));
cart.add(new Book(...));
cart.add(new CompactDisc(...));

for (Media m : cart) {
    System.out.println(m.toString()); // gọi đúng toString() tương ứng
}
